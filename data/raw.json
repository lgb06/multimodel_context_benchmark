    "question": "You are provided with a game interface that mimics \"Minecraft\", where all objects are composed of equal-sized cubes. Players build and explore in this world. They have numerous blocks and can place them following the basic placement rules of \"Minecraft.\" In simple terms, players can place blocks around their current position, and new blocks must be adjacent to existing ones (i.e., sharing a common face). Placing blocks in fluids (such as river water) is allowed, replacing the fluid at that position directly with the block. Players can also sometimes remove blocks.\nThere is a river and a gold ore block in the scene, and the player's position is marked in red. Note that the river is presented in clearly bounded grid forms to allow players to discern the river's width. Suppose the player cannot wade directly through the water nor can they make a horizontal jump to cross the river directly.\nAdditionally, if the gold ore is simply on the ground (i.e., at the height of 1 blocks), the player can directly mine it. Otherwise, n (a positive integer) block(s) is/are under the gold ore so that the gold ore is a height of n+1. Under this circumstance:\n- If there are ladders attached to the block(s) under the gold ore, the player can climb up (if needed) and mine the gold ore directly without consuming any blocks.\n- If there are no ladders attached to the block(s) under the gold ore. We should know that to mine the gold ore, the player's upper body (assuming the player is 2 blocks tall) must not be below the gold ore's height. For example, if the gold ore is located at a height of 2 blocks, the player can directly mine the gold ore. However, if the gold ore is at a height of 3 blocks, the player cannot mine it directly. The player can instead build blocks under his feet to raise his height. For instance, if the player builds 2 blocks under his feet, he will reach a height of 4 blocks.\nOn rare occasions, the red sign indicating the player's position may be fully blocked by the blocks, thus making it invisible. In this case, we consider that the player and the gold ore are on the same side of the river.\n\nQuestion: To obtain the gold ore, what is the minimum number of blocks the player needs to consume?",
    "answer": "6",
    "analysis": "First, from the scene we can see that the player and the gold ore are on the opposite sides of the river. So the player needs to cross the river first. Based on the rules, the player can build a bridge on the river by placing blocks in it. To have the minimum number of blocks, the bridge should just be vertical to the river bank and the number of the blocks needed is the width of the river, which is 3. Suppose the player has crossed the river. From the image we can see that there are no ladders, and the gold ore, on the top of 4 blocks, is at a height of 5 blocks. The player is 2 blocks tall. Therefore, the player needs to build 5 - 2 = 3 block(s) under his feet to reach the gold ore.So the player needs to consume a minimum of 3 + 3 = 6 block(s). The answer is 6.",
